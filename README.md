# House-Price-Prediction

Welcome to the PRODIGY_ML_01 repository! This project focuses on predicting house prices using a Linear Regression model. The repository consists of the following key components:

## Datasets

- **train.csv:** Training dataset containing features for model training.
- **test.csv:** Testing dataset for evaluating the model's performance.

## Predictions

- **test_with_predictions.csv:** Predicted house prices for the training dataset.

## Model Implementation

- **Linear_Regression.ipynb:** Python script containing code for training the Linear Regression model and making predictions.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mennaemam12/PRODIGY_ML_01.git
   cd PRODIGY_ML_01
   
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. **Run the Model:**
    
    ## Running the IPython Notebook
    
    1. **Install Jupyter:**
       If you don't have Jupyter installed, you can install it using the following command:
       ```bash
       pip install notebook

    2. ### Launch Jupyter:
       Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt to start Jupyter Notebooks or JupyterLab:
       ```bash
       jupyter notebook

    3. ### Open the Notebook:
       1. In the Jupyter interface, navigate to the directory where your `.ipynb` file is located.
       2. Click on the notebook file (`Linear_Regression.ipynb`) to open it.
          
    4. ### Run the Notebook:
      1. Inside the notebook, run individual cells by selecting a cell and pressing `Shift + Enter`.
      2. Alternatively, you can run all cells by selecting `Run -> Run All` from the menu.
   
## Explore the Results

1. **Analyze the Predictions:**
   - Examine the predictions in `predicted_train.csv` to gain insights into the model's performance on the training dataset.

2. **Modify the Script:**
   - Tailor the `Linear_Regression.ipynb` script to suit your specific use case. Feel free to customize the features, parameters, or any other aspects of the model to better address your requirements.
